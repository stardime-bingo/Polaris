# Docket upstream changelog

Preserved from the MIT-licensed upstream project. Polaris versions are tracked in the root changelog.

All notable changes to Docket will be documented in this file.

## [1.12.1] — 2026-06-22

### ✨ New
- **Tip Jar.** If you enjoy Docket, you can leave an optional tip (☕ / 🍕 / 🎉) from the bottom of Settings, or via the new "Tip Jar" item in the menu-bar right-click menu (which jumps straight to it). Built on StoreKit 2 with consumable in-app purchases — no subscriptions, no accounts.

### 🌙 Dark Mode
- **The whole UI now follows macOS system Dark Mode.** Previously only the explicit "Night" theme rendered dark, so on a Mac set to Dark the header, empty-state text, cards, and scrim could appear dark-on-dark. Every theme now adapts: backgrounds and cards darken, and label colors are lightened just enough to stay legible against a dark surface.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Reminders sync authorization.** Use the modern `.fullAccess` EventKit status check (the old `.authorized` was deprecated on macOS 14). Two-way sync correctly requires full access, since it both reads and writes reminders.
- **Global shortcut double-press.** The ⌘⇧D double-press quick-add works again when the popover is already open, by also listening locally while Docket is frontmost.
- **App icon & metadata** for App Store distribution: full 1024px icon set, `LSApplicationCategoryType`, and sandbox-friendly entitlements.

### 🧹 Code quality
- Centralized the system-appearance check in one `AppTheme.systemIsDark` helper.
- Tip Jar copy and the new "Support" section are fully localized (English + Italian).
- Migrated the global hotkey off the legacy Carbon API to `NSEvent` monitors.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-06-22

### 🎨 Colors & Icons
- **Expanded color palette to 20 curated colors** (was 8). Hand-tuned mid-tones organized by hue family (warms → greens → blues/purples → pinks/neutrals) so labels and lists read clearly on every theme.
- **Lists now have their own color identity.** Click the swatch on the left of a list row to pick a color from the palette; the chosen color shows up in the list switcher dropdown next to each list name and persists across launches. Lists without a stored color get a stable color derived from their identity, so nothing ever looks "uncolored".
- **Custom hex colors via the system color panel.** A "Custom…" row in every color picker opens the native macOS color picker for users who want a brand-exact tint outside the palette.
- **Unified color picker across Settings.** Lists, labels, and the four Eisenhower-Matrix quadrants (Do First / Schedule / Delegate / Eliminate) all share the same picker UI and palette — no more inconsistent strips of circles.
- **Icon picker matches the color picker.** Each label row gets a small icon button next to its color swatch; click it to open a 5×3 grid of curated SF Symbols. Selected cell highlights in the label color; tooltips and VoiceOver labels are localized in English and Italian.

### ✨ List & Label management
- **Inline edit / delete buttons follow macOS HIG.** Replaced the bare `pencil.line` and `xmark` icons with proper compact tinted-circle action buttons (Mail/Reminders/Photos pattern): 26pt hit-target, hover and press feedback, system red for destructive, `.help()` tooltips and matching VoiceOver labels.
- **Edit / delete reveal on row-hover.** Rows stay clean at rest; pencil and trash fade in when you hover the row, mirroring how Reminders and Notes treat secondary actions. Right-click on the row gives the same actions in a contextual menu.
- **Edit form simplified.** With color and icon now editable from the row swatches (and persisted live), the edit form is just the name field. The trailing pencil flips to a single ✓ checkmark while editing; pencil + trash reappear on commit.
- **Auto-focus the rename TextField.** Clicking the pencil drops the cursor straight into the name field. Press Return (or click ✓) to commit, click outside the field to keep editing.
- **Auto-commit pending edits when switching rows.** Starting to edit a different list or label first commits whatever's in-flight on the previous row, so a half-typed name is never silently dropped.
- **Empty-name protection.** Trims whitespace and falls back to the previous name if the field is left empty, instead of saving an empty string.
- **Confirmation dialog before deleting a label.** Used to delete silently — and labels are referenced by tasks, so the confirmation now explains how many tasks will lose the label.
- **Focus returns to the TextField after dismissing a popover.** Pick a color or icon while renaming, and the cursor jumps back to the name field automatically.

### 🧹 Code quality
- New `ColorPalette` and `IconPalette` enums — single source of truth for the palette, the default values, and (for icons) localized display names.
- Color hex round-tripping (`Color(hex:)` and `Color.toHex()`) consolidated next to the palette they serve.
- New reusable view primitives: `RowActionButton`, `ColorSwatchButton`, `IconPickerButton`, `IconPickerGrid`, `PressableScaleStyle`. Three Settings sections (lists, labels, matrix) now share one color-editing pattern.
- 22 new logic tests (palette round-trip, deterministic fallback stability, `TaskList` legacy-JSON decoder, icon palette invariants).

---

## [1.11.1] — 2026-06-15

### 🐛 Fixes
- **The complete-circle button on a task card works again.** The drag-to-reorder work had attached a high-priority tap to the whole row, which swallowed taps before they reached the button. The row tap is now a normal gesture, so the button (and tap-to-open, swipe, and long-press reorder) all behave correctly.

---

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-10

### 🌍 Localization
- **Docket now speaks English and Italian.** Every user-facing string — task list, create/edit, settings, the Eisenhower matrix, onboarding, pickers, the menu-bar menu, alerts, and notifications — is fully localized and follows your system language.
- All strings route through a single `L10n` catalog backed by `en` / `it` `Localizable.strings` tables; the app declares `CFBundleLocalizations` for English and Italian.
- Not translated by design: your own list/label/task names, macOS system sound names, keyboard-shortcut symbols, the editable matrix quadrant labels, and the (English-only) smart-date keywords.

To preview a language without changing your system setting: `open Docket.app --args -AppleLanguages '(it)'`.

---

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-10

### ✨ Drag to Reorder
- **Long-press a task and drag to reorder it.** After a brief hold (0.18s) the card grows in place to signal it's grabbed, then floats under the cursor while the other tasks part to make room; release to drop. Replaces the old ▲/▼ reorder arrows.
- **Works in every sort mode.** In *By Due Date* or *By Priority*, starting a drag adopts the currently-visible order as your Custom order and switches to Custom (with a brief "Switched to Custom order" toast) so the drag continues seamlessly.
- **Edge auto-scroll** — drag near the top/bottom of a long list to scroll while dragging.
- A quick click still opens the task; a horizontal swipe still completes/deletes.
- VoiceOver **Move up / Move down** actions as an accessible fallback.

### ✨ Sorting
- New **By Priority** sort mode (High / Medium / Low groups), alongside Custom and By Due Date.

### 🧹 Under the hood
- The lifted card is a floating overlay that tracks the cursor (pure translation); the real row stays as an invisible placeholder so rows part live around the insertion point.
- The task list uses an eager `VStack` so every row is measured correctly even when scrolled.

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-10

### ✨ Settings
- **Reorganized Settings into five labeled groups** — General, Appearance, Notifications, Organize, Sync & Data — with consistent card titles. Appearance controls are consolidated into one **Display** card, and Export / Import / Clear are merged into a single **Data** card. No stored preferences changed.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-10

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Import now persists** and remaps orphaned task lists — imported backups no longer vanish on relaunch.
- **Recurring tasks no longer duplicate** when Reminders sync is on (Docket owns recurrence; no `EKRecurrenceRule` is pushed).
- The global hotkey handler is installed once instead of stacking across shortcut changes.
- The local key monitor is removed on close instead of accumulating across popover reopens.
- Reorder controls hidden while searching; added a **No results** state.
- Reminders sync moved off the main thread and no longer self-triggers a sync loop.

### ✨ Improvements
- Data **schema versioning** + migration scaffold; `os.Logger` on all persistence with surfaced failures.
- Hardened `Color(hex:)`, centralized priority colors, human accessibility labels on toolbar buttons.
- Added a dependency-free unit test suite (`./run-tests.sh`).
- **Completion confetti toggle** in Settings.

---

## [1.7.10] — 2026-06-04

### ✨ Matrix UX
- **Drop zone background also fades in when items are already in Unassigned.** Previously the dashed-outline drop zone only appeared in the empty state. Now it surfaces behind the populated pill strip too, so the affordance is consistent regardless of whether any tasks are parked there.
- Extracted `dropZoneBackground` as a shared view so both states use the same visual language.

---

## [1.7.9] — 2026-06-04

### ✨ Matrix UX
- **Unassigned drop zone fades in/out** instead of sliding from the top edge — calmer, less distracting transition.

---

## [1.7.8] — 2026-06-04

### ✨ Matrix UX
- **Top-row → Unassigned now works.** Dragging a pill from `Do First` or `Schedule` past the bottom of the *whole* grid now drops it into Unassigned. Previously the cross-over check fired on the first crossed edge — going down past `bounds.height` already mapped to the bottom-row neighbour, so the pill never reached the "below grid" check. Threshold is now `2 × rowHeight + spacing + 30pt` for top-row sources, `rowHeight + 30pt` for bottom-row sources.
- **Unassigned drop zone is now a contextual affordance.** When the strip is empty it stays hidden, exactly like before 1.7.5. As soon as the user picks up a quadrant pill, the empty drop zone fades + slides in from the top edge so the destination is clearly marked. It hides again when the drag ends.

### 🧹 Cleanups
- New `@State isAnyPillDragging` on `MatrixView`, bound into each `TaskDot` — surfaces the gesture state to the matrix without coupling individual pills together.

---

## [1.7.7] — 2026-06-04

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Diagonal drags now land in the diagonal target.** A flick from `Do First` (top-left) toward `Eliminate` (bottom-right) crossed both the right and bottom edges, but the cross-over switch used ternary precedence and matched the right edge first, so the pill ended up in `Schedule`. Detection now checks both axes and recognises the four diagonal cases:
  - `Do First` → `Eliminate` (right + bottom)
  - `Schedule` → `Delegate` (left + bottom)
  - `Delegate` → `Schedule` (right + top)
  - `Eliminate` → `Do First` (left + top)
- **Diagonal landings sit in the corner of the target closest to the source**, not in its centre — so the pill feels like it travelled diagonally across the boundary instead of teleporting.

---

## [1.7.6] — 2026-06-04

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Cross-quadrant moves no longer "drop from the top".** When a pill was dragged into a different quadrant, the source `TaskDot` was destroyed and a new one was created in the target. The new view's `@State position` defaults to `.zero` (the top-left of the quadrant), and `onAppear`'s `seedPosition()` was running inside the still-active `withAnimation(.spring)` transaction wrapping the store mutate — so SwiftUI animated the pill in from `(0, 0)`.
- Removed the `withAnimation` wrapper around the four cross-container mutations (cross-quadrant from `handleDragEnd`, drop-to-Unassigned from `handleDragEnd`, `quadrantBox.dropDestination`, `unassignedSection.dropDestination`). The move is now instant — the pill simply appears at its destination.
- Hardened `onAppear` with `Transaction(animation: nil)` so any future caller that wraps a mutation in `withAnimation` still gets a clean entry.

---

## [1.7.5] — 2026-06-04

### ✨ Matrix UX
- **Unassigned area is always visible.** Now that quadrant pills can be dropped onto it to clear their assignment, the strip is shown even when no tasks live there. The empty state renders a dashed-outline drop zone with a "Drag a pill here to remove it from the matrix" hint, so the affordance is discoverable.
- The drop destination is active in both empty and populated states.

---

## [1.7.4] — 2026-06-04

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Drag tracking is now precise.** The pill's `position` is updated directly during drag instead of via a separate `dragOffset`; the `.animation(_:value:)` modifier was reordered to sit *before* `.position(...)` in the chain so cursor-following updates aren't subjected to a spring. This eliminates the "drops from the top" feel where the pill appeared to snap back to its origin and then spring to the cursor.
- **Quick flicks now cross quadrants reliably.** Cross-over detection uses `value.predictedEndTranslation` (which accounts for gesture momentum) instead of the raw release translation, so a fast flick that physically stops just shy of the boundary still lands in the intended target quadrant.
- **In-quadrant settle uses `.smooth` instead of `.spring`** — critically damped easing, no overshoot, the pill simply eases into its resting place.
- **Diagonal-exit drags now settle gracefully** instead of staying stuck at the cursor: if the predicted endpoint exits the source bounds but doesn't map to any neighbour, the pill is clamped back inside via `settleInside(...)`.
- **Tap detection threshold raised to 3pt of motion before a drag begins**, so a still click can no longer trigger a brief scale-up flicker.

---

## [1.7.3] — 2026-06-04

### ✨ Matrix UX
- **Drag a pill across boundaries with intent preserved.** Cross-quadrant drags now translate the exit-edge crossing into the target quadrant — vertical position is kept on left/right transitions and horizontal position on top/bottom transitions, instead of teleporting to the centre.
- **Cross-quadrant moves animate.** Pills spring into their new spot rather than snapping.
- **Drag a bottom-row pill out the bottom of the matrix to un-assign it.** Returns the task to the Unassigned strip without opening the detail view.
- **Unassigned strip is now a drop target.** Drag a pill onto it from any quadrant to clear its assignment.
- **Empty quadrants show a subtle "Drop tasks here" hint** in the quadrant tint.
- **Marquee paused while dragging** — the title no longer scrolls under the cursor while you reposition a pill.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Pills now re-seat when bounds or settings change.** `onChange(of: initialPosition)` springs each pill to its new computed spot when the window is resized or `Label length` / `Label lines` are adjusted in Settings — previously they stayed pinned to their old absolute coordinates.
- **Anti-collision uses real rectangles.** Switched from a centre-to-centre 38pt distance check to bounding-box intersection (with a 2pt inflation pad), so multi-line pills can no longer visually touch.
- **Tap-vs-drag disambiguation.** A drag with total max distance under 4pt is now treated as a tap, so wiggling the cursor while clicking no longer steals the gesture from the detail-view tap target.

### 🧹 Cleanups
- **`Store.mutate(id:_:)`** centralises the "find item → mutate → persist" pattern. All three matrix call sites now go through it instead of indexing into `store.items` directly.
- **`matrixLineCount` has a single source of truth.** Removed the duplicate `@AppStorage` from `TaskDot` — it's now passed in from the parent.
- **`initialPosition` is `CGPoint?`** instead of using `.zero` as a magic "not yet computed" sentinel.

---

## [1.7.2] — 2026-06-03

### 🐛 Fixes
- Matrix pills now stay fully inside the quadrant border. Previously the position clamp used a small fixed inset (~30pt) instead of the actual pill geometry, so half a pill (~52pt at default settings) could stick outside the box. Both the anti-collision resolver and the drag-end persister now compute clamps from the real pill width/height
- Pill text width is also capped to the available container, so long label-length settings can no longer make a single pill wider than its quadrant

---

## [1.7.1] — 2026-06-03

### ✨ Matrix Pill Marquee
- Hover a truncated task pill in the Eisenhower Matrix to smoothly scroll the title and reveal the rest of the text
- Linear, autoreversing animation at a constant 28pt/sec — long titles take proportionally longer
- Brief 0.25s pause before the first slide, eases back to the resting `…` ellipsis on hover-out
- Pills that already fit get no animation (overflow detected via a hidden measurer)
- Single-line mode only; multi-line pills retain the native truncation behaviour

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-03

### 📊 Eisenhower Matrix Redesign
- Refined, more professional and minimal aesthetic — quieter tinted fills, hairline borders, continuous-corner shapes
- Quadrant headers use small-caps tracked typography (`DO FIRST` / `SCHEDULE` / …) next to a tighter SF Symbol
- Count badges restyled as minimal tinted capsules with monospaced digits
- Axis labels (`URGENT` / `IMPORTANT` / …) refined with proper letter-spacing and tertiary foreground
- Task pills converted from `Capsule` to `RoundedRectangle` with hairline coloured borders and a much subtler shadow
- Soft hover effect on pills, focused/dragged pills lift to the top via `zIndex`

### ✂️ Native Truncation on Pill Labels
- Long titles now truncate with a real `…` ellipsis instead of being hard-cut by `String.prefix`
- Width budget derived from the existing **Label length** setting; respects 1–5 line counts
- Same treatment applied to the Unassigned strip

### 🧲 Anti-Collision for Pill Positioning
- New per-quadrant resolver: when two tasks are stored at (or dragged onto) the same point, the second pill spirals outward by a small delta until it clears every previously placed pill
- Pills can no longer fully overlap inside a quadrant
- Stable, deterministic layout across renders; the user's original drop point is still persisted — only the *visual* position is nudged when needed

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-06-03
